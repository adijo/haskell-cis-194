# Haskell CIS-194
A Repository that contains my solution to Penn's Introduction to Haskell course.

### Introduction to Haskell

* Exercise 1: Write `toDigit` to convert `123` to `[1, 2, 3]` and `toDigitRev` to convert `123` to `[3, 2, 1]`
* Exercise 2: Write `doubleEveryOther` that doubles every other element from the end of the list. `[1, 2, 3]` to `[1, 4, 6]`   and `[1, 2, 3, 4,]` to `[2, 2, 6, 4].`
* Exercise 3: `sumDigits` sums up *every digit* in the list. `sumDigits [16,7,12,5] = 1 + 6 + 7 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 22.` This one
  was fun and I got to use `foldl.`
